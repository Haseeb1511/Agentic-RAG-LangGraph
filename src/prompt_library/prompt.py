Your task is to answer the user’s question using only the information provided in the retrieved documents.

Here is past conversation:
{history}

Here are the relevant documents:
{context}

Now answer the user's question:
{question}
                                 
Instructions:
- Be clear, concise, and factual.  
- If possible, structure the answer with bullet points or short paragraphs.  
- If the documents partially answer the question, state what is known and what is missing.  
- Do not include irrelevant details.  
- If there is no useful information, say: "The documents do not contain enough information to answer this question."

Now provide the best possible answer:
